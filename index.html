<h1> La Palestra Privacy Policy</h1>


Last Updated: March 8, 2017


<p> This Privacy Policy is effective immediately once anyone begins using the App (as defined below) and will become effective on March 8, 2017 for pre-existing users.
At La Palestra (“LPMG”), we respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining your trust. This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with your use of our products and services, including our consumer-facing mobile application (“La Palestra App”), our online business management app (“App”), and any other LPMG products and services offered through any other websites and mobile applications that direct you to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “App”). When you access or use the App, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
1. Defined Terms.
The following terms will have the meanings indicated below. Please refer to our Terms of Service for any capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy.
“End User” means any individual who interacts with the App, including users of our mobile applications such as the La Palestra App, and individuals who book appointments, purchase services and otherwise interact with our Subscribers through the App.
“Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as browser and device information, app usage data, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information and other information provided by you, and aggregated information.
“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person, such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, and social media account ID.
“Subscriber” is any business or entity that subscribes to (or otherwise accesses or uses) our App.</p>


<p>2. Information We Collect.
We may collect information about you whenever you use the App, for example:
* When you create an account on the La Palestra App, we may ask for Personal Information such as your name, email, mailing address, social media account ID, and other information you may provide with your account. You can edit certain information in your account through the Profile tab in the app.
* If you’re a customer of one of our Subscribers, we collect information about you when you interact with their business through the App. For example, if you initiate a transaction with the Subscriber through the App, such as an appointment or purchase, we may collect information about you, such as your name, email, credit card information, as well as any other information you provide in order to process the transaction.
* If you’re a Subscriber, we collect information about your business that is submitted to the App under your account. When you sign up for our App, we ask for your company name, address, phone number, email, credit card information, tax identification number, and other information about your business, as well as names and email addresses of authorized individuals on your account. We also collect Personal Information about your customers that they provide to the App when they initiate a transaction with you, such as an appointment or purchase.

6. Tracking and Advertising.
We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways.  We and/or our third party partners may employ various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and analytics software, that help us better manage content on our App by informing us what content is effective. 
Cookies
When you visit our website or otherwise interact with the App we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other devices. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to help personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our site.
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but some features on the site will not function properly.

Web Beacons
We may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our App. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the App to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to our Subscribers’ and End Users’ Personal Information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Flash and HTML5 Storage

7. Facebook Connect.
You can log in to our App using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this App to your profile page to share with others within your network.

8. Referral Contact Information.

Your friend may contact us at contact@lapalestra.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
When using this feature, we will access the contact list of your device for the sole purpose of assisting you in finding individuals to whom you wish to send these communications.
